While the tool is running it sends status updates in your Twitter time line as 
messages to the authorized account. Replies and retweets are send additionally.

Each message that arrives from the authorized user to the Jabber account the
bot is listening on will be send to Twitter as status update. But keep in mind
to leave them shorter than 140 chars, otherwise the bot won't send it and gives
you an reply informing you about your failure.

In addition you can send some command to the bot. These command start with an
exclamation mark (!). Each message starting with ! is understood as command.
The following commands are available:

!help
	list of available commands

!follow [USER]
	follow the user USER

!unfollow [USER]
	stop following the user USER

!profile [USER]
	print the profile of USER
